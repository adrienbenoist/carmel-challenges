Cool, you have an email account but do you have a Dropbox account ?
If you already have one, Chunky is really happy :) so you can continue by typing in your terminal:

```  
chunky carmel next
```

But, no worries if you do not; I also created an article to go through all the steps in order to create a Dropbox account:

ps: As I wrote this article some time ago, the images can dffer from the reality.

When you are done with it, type in your terminal:

```  
chunky carmel next
```
