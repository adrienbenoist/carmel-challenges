Lets load your file.

I hope you already copied the link of your file :)

If not here is a hint: You have ro localised your file in your Dropox. Then, share the file from the proposed button and finally create a link. Copy that link as we are gonna use it now.

In your product, look up the ```chunks/{{chunkName}}/chunk.json``` and open it up.

Inside this file, look for the **{{routeName}} route** element. Remember, it should look something like this:

```  
"routes": {
    "{{routeName}}": {
    ...
    }
}
```
Now, find the **cover** element within the **{{routeName}} route**. Here's how it should look:

```  
"routes": {
    "{{routeName}}": {
        ...
        "components": {
            "intro": {
                ...
                "text": "{{route.components.intro.text}}",
                ...
            }
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Great, simply change **{{route.components.intro.text}}** by **dropbo://** following by your link.

Congrats, you know a simple way to show content from Dropbox using the link of the file into your product.
